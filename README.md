# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Lorenzo J Shepherd, citizen of the glorious country of Australia, however currently stuck-sh in the **country**, that apparently is called the United Kingdom.

I am somewhat skilled in Git, Helm, Kubernetes, Google Workspace (admin console, etc), IT Networking, Computer Hardware, and Docker.

I hope that it does not stur any feelings, but I do use Arch Linux on the daily, paired with i3 and Xorg. Hence me saying that **I use Arch Linux btw**.

Currenty working as a Junior DevOps engineer (apprentice) @ LiveWyer

## What's new!

Nothing really.

## Socials (how to reach me)

Unfortunately, I don't use many (if any) **social** media platforms, as I think they are all data harvesters that collect our infomation.

However, I do have some social media platforms that you can reach out to me on (or at least the ones that I want you to know...):
